# Landing Page Project

# Details from starter project:
The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

# Details from updated project:
Interactive and responsive project that programmatically builds the top navigation, scrolls to anchors from navigation, highlights section in viewport upon scrolling, collapses sections, and moves users back to the top of the screen.
